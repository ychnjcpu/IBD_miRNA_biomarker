# IBD miRNA Biomarker Project

Goal: Explore publicly available datasets to identify microRNAs
upregulated in IBD patients as potential biomarkers.

## Workflow
1. Download GEO datasets with miRNA expression.
2. Differential expression analysis using `limma`.
3. Visualize candidate miRNA expression.
